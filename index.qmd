# About Me

I am currently a fourth year math and statistics student at UCSB and I'm in the proccess of applying to statistics and biostatistics PhD programs. 

My research interests include causal inference, machine learning, biostatistics, and statistical genomics. I am particularly interested in projects that center the experiences and well-being of the LGBTQ+ community.
